Learning how to use github!

Hello readers!

This is complexicality. For the majority of my work experience, I've been the person who "figures it out".
In a job description, the term that is typically used is "generalist" but I prefer to be called a dabbler.
I have a curious mind and when I want to know more about something I throw myself into it until I'm satisfied.

About five years ago, I started learning HTML/CSS and thought I wanted to be a web developer.
About two years ago, I used that information to start dabbling in Andriod.
These days, I'm starting to explore what IT management means for a company and it's customers.

I like to let people know what I'm up to, but after letting people in, I'm always surprised at what comes out 
of their mouths. No one I know says anything as direct such as "you're not smart enough to do this" but instead, 
they ask questions that seems like they're more about them then they are about me. Questions like: 

  "Why would anyone want to be a developer? Is that even a real job?"
  "Why don't you go back to working in Human Resources? You have a lot of experience in that area"
  "Are you sure you want to go into IT? Isn't it sexist? Aren't you conncerned about the awkwardness?"
  "Are you sure you're interested in this? You just don't seem like the type"

I try to not let these comments get to me. Instead, I want to be the one to show people how accessible the computer field can
be for people with a limited tech background.
